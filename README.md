# HawkEye
This is a concept on intrusion detection using Python libraries face detection and OpenCV. 


## This is done on Linux and Windows Platforms(Might work on MacOS) 
* The face recognition model might not work well on children as it is trained for the adults.
`(The features in Adults are easy to identify and almost every small child looks same)`
 

## Install face recognition with pip
```Linux
pip install face_recognition
```

__You need OpenCV too__:
```
pip install OpenCV
```
(**All the requirements are specified in requirements.txt**)



* If you cannot install opencv on windows,then go the link below:
